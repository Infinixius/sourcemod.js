Installation is split into two steps, the **server** installation, which means installing sourcemod.js and SourceMod onto your Source server, and the **client** installation, which means installing the npm module and connecting.

Make sure you have the following before continuing:

- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (should come with Node)
- Any Source server (Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, etc)
- An internet connection

Once you've gotten the prerequisites, go ahead and start off with the [server installation]{@tutorial InstallationServer}.
